Sorting is a very common task and fundamental in programming 
Each algorithm has its own pros and cons

**********************
Bubble Sorting
**********************
Compare each number to its next and swap so that the highest number bubbles up to the end of the array
Big o : npow2
Works really well in case of nearly sorted data 

**********************
Selection Sorting
**********************
Select the minimum and move it to the begining
Better than bubble sort cause swaping only happens once
Big o : npow2
Does not perform well in nearly sorted data 

**********************
Insertion Sorting    
**********************
Loops through the array and inserts the element being evaluated at the correct place in the already evaluated portion of the array
Big o : n pow 2
Works really well in case of nearly sorted data 
Works well in case of streaming data 


The above sorting algorithms don't scale very well. They work well with small data but not for huge amount of data

**********************
 Merge Sort 
**********************
keep spliting the array until you are left with single arrays and then merge them while sorting
