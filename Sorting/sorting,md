Sorting is a very common task 
Each algorithm has its own pros and cons

Bubble Sorting
Compare each number to its next and swap so that the highest number bubbles up to the end of the array
Big o : npow2


Selection Sorting
Select the minimum and move it to the begining
Better than bubble sort cause swaping only happens once

Insertion Sorting 
Loops through the array and inserts the element being evaluated at the correct place in the already evaluated portion of the array
