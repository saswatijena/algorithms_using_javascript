Big O is the best case complexity for a given algorithm
    * Ignore constants 
        e.g if the complexity of an algorithm is 2N then we can sefely ignore the constant 2, hence the complexity is 2N
        similarly if the complexity is 2N+5 is also 2N
    * linear 
    * logrithmic
    * quadratic
    * exponential
