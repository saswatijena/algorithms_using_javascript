# Data structures

Data structures are collections of values and relationships among them or actions to be performed on them for e.g add, sort, remove, etc.

### Singly Linked List

- Contain head, tail and length property
- Consists of nodes, each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
- **Big O :**

  - Inserting :**O(1)** at the beigining or end of the list
  - Removal : **O(1)** at the begining and **O(n)** at the end of the list
  - Searching : **O(n)**
  - Access : **O(n)**

- Excels at insertion and deletion in comparision to array.

### Doubly Linked List 
- Contains head, tail and length property 
- Consists of nodes, where each node has a value and points to next as well as previous node. 
- takes up more memory is one of the drawbacks which is almost always a tradeoff :)
